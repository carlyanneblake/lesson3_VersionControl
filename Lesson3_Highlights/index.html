            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VSC is a version control system. This is an important concept because it keeps track of all files that you have updated, changed, or modified over time. It records these changes in order to allow you to access a previous version, and revert back to it over time. If you were to simply try and organize files by using naming conventions, this would become tedious, confusing, and overall unorganized. VCS also allows you to recover files more easily. There is one repository that houses all of the files. Workers can access file(their own copy), make changes to the files, and then commit them into the repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many advantages of virtual control systems over naming conventions. One of the main advantages is that it solves the file-sharing problem. It does this by allowing each user to have his or her own copy to edit and make changes to. The repository houses all of these changes. It also prevents people for over-riding files, accidently deleting files, etc. It also keeps records of important information such as who made changes to the file, what changes were made, when the changes were made, etc. It also allows users to revert back to older versions of a file should the need arise. Users are also able to share their files with others.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is one specific version of version control systems. It is popular for a variety of reasons, but one of the most important is that it is locally enabled. This means that you do not need to be connected to a server in order to version control. Contrary to CVCS, GIT has the project history on your own local disk. In addition to allowing version control at any time, GIT is also faster because it does not need to retrieve a version of a file from server. It can access the history of a file from your own personal device. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three states your file can be in. The GIT directory, is where committed files are. It is important because it is what is copied when you clone a repository. Committed file are securely stored in the database. The staging area is where modified files that have not been committed are located. Modified files are changed but not committed to the database. The working tree is a single version of a file. If a file has been changed but not staged, it is modified. There are ways to commit a file before it is staged, by using specific commands. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Checksum</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Checksum, otherwise known is SHA-1-hash within GIT, is a 40 character long string of hexadecimal numbers and characters used in order to checksum a file. The file is then stored and referred to by that number rather than its original file name. As a result, nothing can be added or lost within GIT without its knowledge.  It is extremely difficult to lose files from GIT once they are pushed into the repository. They only way to lose information in GIT is before they are committed. Most of the changes made in GIT add data to the database rather than deleting them. </p>
